Technology Stack
python - is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.

Django - is a high-level Python web framework that enables developers to build robust, scalable, and secure web applications quickly and efficiently

django-framework - is a high-level open-source web framework written in Python. It promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

Docker - is an open-source platform designed to help developers build, ship, and run applications inside lightweight, portable, and isolated containers

Github-actions -  is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) tool built directly into GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows such as building, testing, and deploying your code whenever changes are pushed to your repository.

GraphQL - is a query language and runtime for APIs developed by Facebook in 2012 and released as open-source in 2015. It provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST for building APIs


Database Design.

The Airbnb Clone project relies on a well-structured relational database to manage users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments. Below are the key entities and their relationships:

Users
Represents both hosts and guests.

id: Unique identifier for each user

name: Full name of the user

email: Email address (used for login)

password: Hashed password for authentication

role: Defines if the user is a guest, host, or admin

Relationships:

A user can list multiple properties

A user can make multiple bookings

A user can leave multiple reviews

Properties

Represents a property listed by a host.
id: Unique identifier for each property
title: Name of the property
description: Detailed description
ocation: City or region where the property is located
price_per_night: Cost per night of stay
Relationships:
Each property belongs to one user (host)
A property can have many bookings and reviews

Bookings

Represents a reservation made by a guest.
id: Unique identifier for each booking
user_id: Reference to the guest who made the booking
property_id: Reference to the booked property
start_date: Start date of the reservation
end_date: End date of the reservation
Relationships:
Each booking is made by one user
Each booking is for one property

Reviews

Represents feedback left by guests after their stay.
id: Unique identifier for each review
user_id: Reviewer (guest)
property_id: Reviewed property
rating: Numeric rating (e.g., 1–5)
comment: Optional text review
Relationships:
A user can review many properties
A property can have multiple reviews

Payments

Represents a completed payment transaction.
id: Unique identifier for each payment
booking_id: Reference to the associated booking
user_id: Payer (usually the guest)
amount: Total amount paid
status: Payment status (e.g., completed, failed)
Relationships:
Each payment is tied to one booking
Each booking has one corresponding paymen


Feature Breakdown

User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access personal data or perform actions like booking and property listing.

Property Management
Hosts can list properties by providing details such as title, description, location, price, and images. Listings are stored and displayed to potential guests through a searchable interface.

Booking System
Users can view available properties and make reservations for specific dates. The system ensures that bookings do not overlap and confirms reservations with pricing details.

Search and Filtering
Users can search for properties by location, date, price range, and number of guests. Filters help users find suitable options quickly, improving the browsing experience.

Image Upload and Gallery
Hosts can upload images for each property to give guests a visual idea of the accommodation. A gallery view enhances property presentation and user engagement.

Review and Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings after their stay, helping future users make informed decisions. Hosts can also respond to feedback, fostering trust and transparency.

Dashboard and User Interface
Both hosts and guests have access to personalized dashboards showing their listings, bookings, and reviews. This feature improves user experience and keeps all relevant information organized.

Notification System
The system provides email or in-app notifications for key actions such as booking confirmations, cancellations, and review updates. This ensures timely communication between users and the platform

API Security

Authentication
We implement secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based tokens to verify the identity of users. This ensures that only legitimate users can access their accounts and interact with the system.

Authorization
Role-based access control is enforced to ensure users can only perform actions they’re permitted to (e.g., only hosts can list properties, only guests can book). Endpoints are protected to restrict access based on user roles.

Rate Limiting
API rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse, spam, and brute-force attacks by restricting the number of requests from a single IP or user within a given time frame.

Data Validation & Sanitization
All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

HTTPS & Secure Headers
All API communication is secured over HTTPS, and secure HTTP headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options) are configured.

CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines are automated workflows that streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. Continuous Integration ensures that code changes are automatically tested and merged into the main branch, while Continuous Deployment ensures that successful changes are automatically deployed to production or staging environments.

Importance
CI/CD pipelines help maintain code quality, reduce human error, speed up development cycles, and ensure consistent deployments. They are essential for efficient collaboration, especially in projects with multiple contributors.

GitHub Actions – Automates testing, linting, and deployment workflows on each push or pull request.

Docker – Packages the application into containers to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
